These scripts were used to extract the synonymous and missense SNPs based on the annotation of the vaquita genome (getSynMisSNPs/), and to generate the projected and folded SFS using a modification of easySFS (easySFS.abModified.3.noInteract.Exclude01Sites.HetFiltering.20181121.py) which
also filters out sites with excess (>75%) heterozygosity. First, all possible projection values are assessed (easySFS_1_ProjectionPreview.sh), then the output is parsed (easySFS_2_parseProjectionPreview.shell.sh) and the optimal projection value is chosen (easySFS_3_determineOptimalProjection.R).
Then, projection is carried out (easySFS_4_CarryOutProjection.sh).
