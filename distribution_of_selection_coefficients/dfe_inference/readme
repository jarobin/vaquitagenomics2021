These scripts were originally written by Jon Mah and modified by Annabel Beichman.
They will first carry out demographic inference on using the synonymous SFS using dadi, then infer the distribution of selection coefficients based on the missense SFS using fitdadi. 

The wrapper script (fitdadi_infer_DFE.Vaquita.TwoEpochOnly.Wrapper.ForGithub.sh) can be used to see how varying different parameters such as the mutation rate or ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous sites affects the inferred distribution.
